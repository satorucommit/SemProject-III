🎉 NASA PATENT FORECASTING SYSTEM - SUCCESSFULLY FIXED!
================================================================

✅ PROBLEM SOLVED:
The "Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime" error has been completely resolved!

✅ WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. CSV file encoding issues (UTF-16 vs UTF-8)
2. TensorFlow compatibility problems
3. Missing sample patent data  
4. Topic modeling parameter issues
5. Trend analysis configuration

✅ CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ TensorFlow 2.15.0 working correctly
- ✅ 25 sample NASA patents loaded
- ✅ Topic discovery functional (8 technology topics)
- ✅ Trend analysis working
- ✅ Patent evaluation system operational

✅ HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM:

1. SIMPLE DEMO (Recommended for testing):
   python simple_demo.py
   
   This will:
   - Load and analyze patent data
   - Discover technology topics
   - Test patent idea classification
   - Offer interactive evaluation

2. FULL SYSTEM (Complete forecasting pipeline):
   python main.py
   
   This runs the complete system with:
   - Data loading & preprocessing
   - Topic discovery using NLP
   - Time-series trend analysis
   - Machine learning model training
   - Interactive patent evaluation

✅ SAMPLE PATENT IDEAS TO TEST:
- "Advanced solar panel technology for spacecraft"
- "Artificial intelligence navigation system"
- "Robotic maintenance system for space stations"
- "Quantum communication array for satellites"
- "Life support recycling technology"

✅ DISCOVERED TECHNOLOGY TOPICS:
Topic 0: Space, radiation, systems, technology
Topic 1: Robotic, earth, gravity, zero gravity  
Topic 2: Construction, lunar, mars, technology
Topic 3: Terrain, planetary surfaces, autonomous
Topic 4: Deep space, exploration missions
Topic 5: Fuel, advanced, orbital, precision
Topic 6: Analysis, atmospheric, planetary
Topic 7: Carbon, ultra, construction

✅ SYSTEM CAPABILITIES:
- Patent data analysis and preprocessing
- Technology topic discovery using NLP
- Time-series trend analysis
- Patent idea classification and evaluation
- Interactive user interface
- Trend-based recommendations

✅ NEXT STEPS:
1. Run: python simple_demo.py
2. Enter patent ideas when prompted
3. Get instant technology trend analysis
4. Type 'quit' to exit

The system is now fully operational and ready to evaluate patent ideas! 🚀
