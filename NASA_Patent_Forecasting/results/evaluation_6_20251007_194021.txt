Patent Idea: A method for enhancing the development process of silver halide photographic film for use in space-based telescopes. The invention comprises a new chemical composition for the developer bath that reduces grain size and improves sensitivity to low-light conditions. This process allows for higher-fidelity analog image capture on physical film plates, providing an alternative to digital sensors for specific long-duration exposure applications. The system also includes a mechanism for in-orbit film handling and processing.
