Patent Idea: An autonomous navigation system for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) designed for planetary exploration. The system utilizes a decentralized machine learning model where each drone shares sensor data, including optical and lidar imaging, to collectively build a high-resolution 3D map of the terrain. The core invention is a novel consensus algorithm that allows the swarm to make real-time decisions for pathfinding and obstacle avoidance without a central controller, improving mission robustness and data collection efficiency
